# ProjectDocs

A fancy but minimalistic Google Docs-like static site. Create folders and pages, edit your own docs, and enjoy a low-poly, animated UI. All data is stored in your browser (no backend).

## Features
- Login/signup (per-user docs)
- Create/rename/delete folders and pages
- Infinite-scroll style text editor (simple textarea)
- Cool low-poly buttons and subtle animations
- Only the doc owner can edit; others are view-only
- All data is local (localStorage)
- Fully static, deployable to GitHub Pages

## Usage
- Open index.html or deploy to GitHub Pages
- Sign up, then login
- Create folders and pages
- Edit your own docs. Others are view-only unless you login as that user.

## Limitations
- Not secure (passwords are hashed but stored locally)
- Data is per-browser (no sync)
- For demo/personal use only

Enjoy ProjectDocs!
